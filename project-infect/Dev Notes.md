#  Dev Notes

Latest Progress:
    basic algo that allows for rotating an zombieVirus node and point to a next node that it can infect and changes that node and connecting nodes to that player's color declaring that those nodes are now that player's zombie strain

Next planned steps:
    need to set up player turns, only allow players to make moves on their turn
    restrict players to only be able to click on their color/zombieVirus strains
    
    
    
Thoughts & Logic:
    If whole board is completely randomized - it can lead to unfair advantage from one player over another, so we will randomize half the board and then mirror it so that both sides are same
